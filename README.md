# Titanic
For code etc. related to kaggle competition data (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate a simple analysis of a small dataset that highlights some of the common operations used by a data scientist.

## Requirements
* Dataset.  This uses the Titanic data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.  There is a copy of the data in the \data folder.
* SPSS Modeler.  In order to open the streams (*.str files), you need IBM SPSS Modeler.
* Notebook.  In order to run the Python notebooks (*.ipynb files), you need access to a notebook environment, like Data Science Experience.  If you just want to examine the code, or alter it to run locally, you can look at the .py file

## Setup
Note that the Source nodes in the Modeler streams and the Read/Write statements in the notebooks may need to be adjusted to your environment.

## Folder structure
* .\    : code like notebooks, streams, etc.
* .\data: the data from the kaggle competition
* .\docs: presentations, reports, visualizations, etc.
